    <p>When will COVID’s impact on the automotive industry finally falter and allow the industry to recover? Since the beginning of the pandemic, the automotive industry has tremendously struggled in many ways. Focusing on General Motors, they have faced disruptions in the production delays in their suppliers, insufficient inventory for production, limited container availability with their ocean carriers, and limited space to store unfinished cars. Now, General Motor’s logistics operation managers do not see the semi-conductor chip shortage as a problem that will be solved anytime soon.</p>
    <p>For the last year, General Motors has been feeling the heat of the chip shortage and have taken many steps to wait the problem out. This summer, GM shut down four of their plants while waiting for their needed supplies to reach their production facilities without disclosing when the plants would be up and running. Furthermore, GM made a deal with Michigan State University to store their unfinished cars that are missing hundreds of semi-conductor chips. Throughout the summer, anyone driving by the lots could see the hundreds of cars being stored and the added security detail to ensure the cars remained safe. Storing the vehicles at MSU cost GM $75,000 for three months, without accounting for the extra security costs (Lyons, 2021). As this deal was only made for the summer since the university needed the lot space for their students and faculty, GM has been struggling to figure out what to do with these mostly finished vehicles. General Motors has also been storing 15,000 vehicles at the Lansing Delta Township according to an employee there.</p>

    <h2 id ="impact_plans"> GM’s Plans to Meet Demand</h2>

    <p>Currently, GM has not been doing well in meeting the consumer demand for vehicles. According to an article from the New York Times, General Motors had 128,757vehicles in dealer inventories. Less than 211,974 at the end of June and 334,000 at the end of the first quarter. In the last several years, the figure typically fell around 800,000 (Boudette, 2021).Erin Davis, a spokesperson for General Motors has commented on the chip shortage and their plans for meeting consumer demand. He stated “… we intend to build vehicles without certain modules and will complete them as soon as possible. This will help us quickly meet strong customer demand as semiconductors become available” (Lyons, 2021). </p>
    <p>Many vehicles will be missing features that add comfort and convenience which separates them from competition. Several types of cars have announced changes in their production plans. Cadillac recently announced that they will suspend the inclusion of the Super Cruise driver assistance systems in the new Escalade SUVs that allow drivers to drive with no hands on certain “well marked” highways temporarily. Furthermore, GM will be selling some of their Enclave and Traverse SUV Models without a wireless phone charging feature. To make up for this short-coming on GM’s part, they will be offering consumers a $75 credit. GM also announced in June that it would not include the automatic stop/start feature on some of the full-sized trucks and SUV’s (Hall, 2021).This means consumers should ensure when shopping for a car that they read the fine print of what is and is not included in the car. Though costs are higher than ever before for most cars, the quality and features do not 100% reflect that anymore, and it is the consumers job to do their research.</p>
